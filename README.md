# Python Projects Night
Welcome to the git repository of Python Projects Night organized by Chicago Python User Group or ChiPy.
We meet every third Thursday of the month, at 6:30 pm at Braintree's Chicago Office.
Join our one hour workshops to learn problem solving with Python - Webdev, Data Science, Python 101, TDD! Learn something new every month.

# Team Projects
These projects are meant for those who are familiar with Python Syntax and looking to take their learning to the next step.
You will be a part of group of 4 and solve a problem within 1 hour using Python.
Each team would be using 2 laptops - one for coding and one for research.
Every team member would have 15 minutes of keyboard time.
After 15 minutes, the control of the keyboard would switch to the next team member.


# Upcoming Team Projects
### Testing with Python


# What should you bring
* Wi-fi powered laptop, power chord
* Python: 2.7 or 3.5
* Text editor: Atom, Sublime Text

# Previous Projects
### Python101
#### Python Koans
For this exercise we will learn the Zen of Python using Test Driven Development.
Python Koans is a suite of broken tests, which are written against Python code that demonstrate how to Pythonic code.
Your job is to fix the broken tests by filling in the missing parts of the code.

#### Python Team Projects
The organizers of Project Nights need your help! Grouping attendees for Project Night team project is a manual task. Why do it manually, when we can automate it? We open up the problem to you.


### WebDev
#### Flask Team Projects
Build a web app for to group the Python project night  attendees.

#### Flask Collage
Build a small web app using Flask which accepts the meetup.com event id for tonight
as a parameter and would fetch the profile pictures of all the attendees to create a
collage.

### Data Science

#### Data Analysis With Pandas
Pandas is the defacto package for data analysis in Python. In this project, we are going to use the basics of pandas to analyze the interests of project Night's attendees. What can we learn about the Python Project Night's attendees by mining their meetup.com
profile data?

#### Diversif.ai
Diversity in tech communities has been a widely addressed topic. As one of the most active tech community in the world, in this exercise we would try to measure some aspects of diversity in tech community. We will use image recognition on the meetup.com profile pictures of the members of ChiPy user group and determine determine how diverse our attendees are. Then we will compare the same with other tech groups in the city and around the world.
