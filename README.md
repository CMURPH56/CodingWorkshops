# CodingWorkshop
Python Project Nights are now being organized by ChiPy. Every third Thursday of the month, i.e. the Thursday following ChiPy, we meet at Braintree at 6:30 pm. Join our one hour workshops to learn problem solving with Python - Webdev, Data Science, Python 101, TDD! Learn something new every month.

These workshops are organized as team projects. They are meant for those who are familiar with Python and looking to take their learning to the next step. You will be a part of group of 4 and solve a problem within 1 hour using Python. There will be TA-s to help you. Each team would be using 2 laptops - one for coding and one for research. Every team member would have 15 minutes of keyboard time. After 15 minutes, the control of the keyboard would switch to the next team member.

# Upcoming Schedule

# What should you bring
### Wi-fi powered laptop, power chord
### Python: 2.7 or 3.5
### Text editor: Atom

# Instructions for TAs
- If problem is available on Github, solve the problem.
- Submit pull requests with reference material that would help attendees solve the problem.
- Depending on the number of teams formed on that day, try to serve up one/two team.
- Ensure there is one computer where code gets written and it has the text editor/ide & Python version everyone is comfortable with. A second computer is to be used for research.
- Enforce 15 mins switch rule so that every member gets to write code once.
- Answer the questions the teams might have. Try to avoid providing exact solutions, guide them to the correct path by giving hints.
- Use your judgment if explaining something on the whiteboard might help the team.
- Get feedback on how the problem can be improved.

# Instructions for submitting your team's solution
- Create a fork of this repository for your team
- Create a branch named solution_teamname where teamname is your team's name. Make sure you have a creative team name
- Under the solutions directory, create a folder with your team name
- Include a README.md in that directory. Include the names (and github urls) for each of your team mates
- Include all files for your solution under this directory
- After your final commit, push your branch to github and send a pull request.
